WHY ArrayList: 
- Maintaining Insertion Order
- Unknown Size
- Fast Access by Index
- Adding / removing at the end


methods: 
- basic = add, remove, set, get, clear, size, contains, sort, isEmpty
- addAll, retainAll, removeAll, containsAll


ways to define the ArrayList : 

//good practice
List<String> test = new ArrayList<>();

ArrayList<String> test = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> test = new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<String> test = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange"));

//using java 8 
ArrayList<String> list7 = Stream.of("Foo", "Bar", "Baz").collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));


*** The LinkedList stores its elements in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. 
    To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
    ex: train 

WHY: 
- frequent insertion / deletion 
- unpredictable modifications 


METHODS:
- same as ArrayList 
- addFirst, removeFirst, addLast, removeLast, getFirst, getLast
